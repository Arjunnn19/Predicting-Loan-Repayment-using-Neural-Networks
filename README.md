Project Title: Loan Repayment Prediction with Neural Networks

Project Description:
This project aims to predict loan repayment behaviors using a deep learning model built on a dataset from Lending Club. 
Through comprehensive data preprocessing and the implementation of a neural network using TensorFlow, the model accurately forecasts whether borrowers will fully repay their loans.
The project contributes to better risk assessment in the lending domain, aiding financial institutions in making informed decisions.
